        - inputs:

            - onehot char vector (max word num in sentence, max char num in word, character size)

            - embedded vector of word (max word num in sentence, embedded dimension)

        - network

            - word -(CNN)-> feature by word (w)

            - char -(CNN)-> char embedded vector for each word -(CNN)-> feature by char (c)

            [c, w] -> CNN + max pool over feature -> FC -> output
